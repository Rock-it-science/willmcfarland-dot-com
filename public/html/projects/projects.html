            hosted on AWS using iceCast, and broadcast from my PC using RadioDJ
            and SECaster. There is also a slightly more code-heavy and
            tech-light version available on the site that is explained in more
            detail in the about page on the site.</p></td>

        <td><H3>Mountain Bike Part Picker</H3><br />
            <p>My largest project to date, at over 2500 lines of code. This was
            intended to be a website similar to <a id="inline" href="https://pcpartpicker.com/">
            PC Part Picker</a>, but for mountain bikes. In other words, users would
            be able to lay out all of the parts of a bike and see pricing and
            compatibility of parts. Unfortunately, it was brought to my
            attention that the devs of PC Part Picker were working on a very
            similar project. I have decided to move on from this project, but it
            was a valuable experience, and I learned a lot about web
            development.</p></td>

        <td><H3>Discogs Seller Price Comparator (DSPC)</H3><br />
            <p>The idea behind this project was to make it simpler to find
            record sellers on Discogs who had the most records on your wantlist,
            and compare prices of records including shipping prices.<br />
            I managed to make a working version with limited functionality in
            Java, just through web-scraping, and outputting to a spreadsheet.
            However, this method would run into errors because of the sheer
            number of page requests it needed to send.<br />
            I attempted another version using the official Discogs php api,
            however it didn't have support for fetching from wantlists. So I
            created that method myself in a forked version of the api.
            Unfortunately, I ran into some other problems that caused me to
            leave this project for now, but maybe one day I'll come back to it.</p></td>

            Raspberry Pi. Unfortunately my camera arrived defective, and I have
            to order a new one before I resume production on this project.</p></td>
